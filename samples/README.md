**@google-cloud/connect-firestore** is an [express](http://expressjs.com/)
session store backed by [Google Cloud Firestore][product-docs].

**Note**: Cloud Firestore is a persistent, distributed, transactional database.
Often, it's more appropriate to choose a different storage solution for sessions
such as Memcache or Redis as their designs offer much faster operation in this
use case.
