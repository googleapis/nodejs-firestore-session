introduction: |-
    **_THIS REPOSITORY AND PACKAGE WILL BE DEPRECATED IN JULY 2024_**


    **@google-cloud/connect-firestore** is an [express](http://expressjs.com/)
    session store backed by [Google Cloud Firestore][product-docs].

    **Note**: Cloud Firestore is a persistent, distributed, transactional database.
    Often, it's more appropriate to choose a different storage solution for sessions
    such as Memcache or Redis as their designs offer much faster operation in this
    use case.
